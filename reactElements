JavaScript is used in React to create elements rather than using HTML directly. In the body, we can make a div with the ID "root." 
This is usually where our code goes in a React project. After adding a script tag of type "text/javascript," enter "ReactDOM.render." This is an essential method in the ReactDOM framework that requires two arguments. 

The element we want is first created by "React.createElement". To reproduce the h1, for example, use React to create "h1," null (no extra attributes), and "getting started with React."

The location of the element is specified by the second argument, which in this case is "document.getElementById('root')." 
It means, "Render this element and put it inside the 'root' div." Save, reload, and it's done! We've finished building our first React element.
