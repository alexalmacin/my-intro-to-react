Refactoring elements using JSX
Using JSX to refactor elements in React is a great way to optimize and organize your code to make it easier to read, maintain, and tidy. 
Working with UI elements is more intuitive when you can write HTML-like syntax directly in your JavaScript code thanks to JSX.

Lets say you have a component that renders a simple greeting:
function Greeting() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

The <div> with a <h1> element and the text "Hello, world!" is rendered using this component. 
To make your code more modular and reusable, let's s imagine you wish to modify this component by separating the <h1> element into a separate component.

Here's how you can do it:

function Greeting() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Greet />
    </div>
  );
}

function Greet() {
  return <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
}

We have developed a new component named Greet in this refactored version, which renders simply the <h1> element. 
Next, we added the Greet component in lieu of the <h1> element in the Greeting component. 
This simplifies and improves the understanding of the Greeting component, particularly when dealing with more intricate UI elements.

Refactoring using JSX involves more than just separating things into discrete componentsâ€”it also entails structuring your code to facilitate simpler management and upkeep. 
For instance, to reduce duplication, you might abstract away common user interface patterns into separate components or divide larger components into smaller, reusable ones.

In general, restructuring elements in React with JSX is about making your code more readable, maintainable, and scalable while also giving it better structure.
